## [JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers)

I am an active developer of packages inside the JuliaSmoothOptimizers organization. These packages are focused on the development of optimization methods for nonlinear optimization.

Some of our main packages:

- [**PDENLPModels.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PDENLPModels.jl): A NLPModel API for optimization problems with PDE-constraints.
- [**DCISolver.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/DCISolver.jl): an optimization solver using the dynamic control of infeasibility method.

---

I am also actively working on [**Stopping.jl**](https://github.com/vepiteski/Stopping.jl): a new framework to implement iterative algorithms. Check out the [docs](https://vepiteski.github.io/Stopping.jl/dev/) that contains plenty of tutorials and examples.
